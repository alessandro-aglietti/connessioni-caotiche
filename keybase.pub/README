The whole application is hosted on Keybase filesystem "kbfs"

https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs

[...] there is no sync model. The files stream in on demand.

[...] As a proof-of-concept, https://keybase.pub is a website that serves static content straight out of /keybase/public. You can see this application at https://aqquadro.keybase.pub/connessioni-caotiche.

./deploy.sh simply rsync ./connessioni-caotiche under vcs with my /keybase/public/aqquadro/connessioni-caotiche streaming folder.

What is behind the curtain?

- simple ECMAScript 6 https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6 ~ 11% can update their browsers too
- no webpack please
- browserify because without require statement we go nowhere
- use libraries only if needed
- no uglify, minify and other -ing things because users need to be able to debug running JS on their browser
- virtual, shadow, shallow DOM yourself. Mustache.js and innerHTML are enough
