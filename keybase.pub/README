The whole application is hosted on Keybase filesystem "kbfs"

https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs

[...] there is no sync model. The files stream in on demand.

[...] As a proof-of-concept, https://keybase.pub is a website that serves static content straight out of /keybase/public. You can see this application at https://aqquadro.keybase.pub/connessioni-caotiche.

./deploy.sh simply rsync ./connessioni-caotiche under vcs with my /keybase/public/aqquadro/connessioni-caotiche streaming folder.
